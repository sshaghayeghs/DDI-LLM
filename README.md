# `DDI-LLM:` Exploring Language-based Drug Chemical Structure Embedding Methods for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction via Graph Convolutional Networks
Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) can arise when multiple drugs are used to treat complex or concurrent medical conditions, potentially leading to alterations in the way these drugs work. Consequently, predicting DDIs has become a crucial endeavor within the field of medical machine learning, addressing a critical aspect of healthcare.

This paper explores the application of language-based embeddings, including BERT, GPT, and LLaMA, within the context of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to enhance DDI prediction.

We start by harnessing these advanced language models to generate embeddings for drug chemical structures and drug descriptions, providing a more comprehensive representation of drug characteristics. These embeddings are subsequently integrated into a DDI network, with GCN employed for link prediction. We utilize BERT, GPT, and LLaMA embeddings to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of predicting drug interactions within this network.

Our experiments reveal that the utilization of language-based drug embeddings in combination with DDI structure embeddings can yield accuracy levels comparable to state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction.
